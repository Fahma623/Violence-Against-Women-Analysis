This project involves data preprocessing, model implementation, and visualization to analyze patterns of violence against women.


## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset on violence against women. Key steps include data preprocessing, model implementation, and visualization to derive insights and predictions.
## Key Steps

1. Data Preprocessing:

* Handled missing values
* One-hot encoded categorical variables

2. Model Implementation:

* Split data into training and testing sets
* Implemented Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression

3. Model Evaluation:

Random Forest Regression:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.92
* R² Score: 0.92

Data Visualization:

* Created visualizations to compare model predictions and identify key trends
## Results

* The Random Forest model achieved the best performance with an MAE of 2.92 and an R² score of 0.92.
* Visualizations provided insights into the patterns and trends in the data, aiding in better understanding of the factors associated with violence against women.
## Dependencies

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
